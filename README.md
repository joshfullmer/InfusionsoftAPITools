# Infusionsoft API Tools

This program currently only has the Table Getter tool, but has the possibility to be added upon in the future.

To use the Table Getter, simply grab the application name and [API key](http://help.infusionsoft.com/userguides/get-started/tips-and-tricks/api-key), and choose a table name from the dropdown.  Here is a [list](https://developer.infusionsoft.com/docs/table-schema/) of all of the available tables and their fields.

Once you hit the "Request Table" button, the program will get all records for the selected table.  You are then able to review the data on the page, or click the link at the top to download the data as a CSV.  

If you have any problems, encounter any bugs, or would like to request a feature, please do so here: https://github.com/joshfullmer/InfusionsoftAPITools/issues.
