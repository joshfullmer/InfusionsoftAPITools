<p class=""blacktextsmall""><font face=""verdana,geneva"" size=""2"">We are all given a unique set of talents when we are born and it is our job to tap into our personal skills and abilities to maximize our potential throughout our lives. While our natural talents help us on our journey to become an effective leader, other skills need to be nurtured and developed.</font></p>
<p class=""blacktextsmall""><font face=""verdana,geneva""><font size=""2""><strong>'#LEADERSHIPtweet'</strong> is a small, practical handbook written for anyone who wants to hone the skills they need to become a remarkable leader. This book outlines a framework and a mechanism for both learning new things and applying current knowledge in a thoughtful and practical way. It provides a guide through the most important leadership competencies, offers a proven method for learning leadership skills, and shows approaches for applying these skills. The book explores real-world concerns such as focus, limited time, incremental improvement, and how we learn.</font></font></p>
<p class=""blacktextsmall""><font face=""verdana,geneva"" size=""2"">Readers will be challenged by the ideas insideÂ -- not because all of them are new, but because the book will encourage them to put what they know into action. It is also intended to be a resource to come back to as a reminder of best practices.</font></p>

</p>
<p>
  <font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3"">While all of these words or phrases may describe a powerful speaker, becoming a great communicator is not about being a great speaker or even about being a good talker.  And while many famous and historical leaders are powerful speakers, the best leaders at any level and any situation are more than good speakers . . . they are great communicators.</font><font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3""></font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3"">It's easy to notice the communication shortcomings of others (insert all your biggest communication gripes hereâ¦), but it may be difficult to articulate the skills that make someone a great communicator. And it may be even more challenging to honestly evaluate our own communication effectiveness. </font><font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3""></font>
</p>
<p>

  <strong><font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3"">Would you like to find ways to increase your teamâs cohesiveness and productivity? </font></strong>

<p>
  <font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3"">Communication is complete when a message is shared <em>and</em> a message is received.  We know that communication is about more than using our mouths, but our ears as well.  Listening is a critical skill of great communicators. But being a great <em>listener</em> is sometimes difficult.</font><font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3""></font>

<p>
  <font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3"">While all of these words or phrases may describe a powerful speaker, becoming a great communicator is not about being a great speaker or even about being a good talker.

<p>
  <font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3"">It's easy to notice the communication shortcomings of others (insert all your biggest communication gripes hereâ¦), but it may be difficult to articulate the skills that make someone a great communicator. And it may be even more challenging to honestly evaluate our own communication effectiveness. </font><font face=""georgia,palatino"" size=""3""></font>
